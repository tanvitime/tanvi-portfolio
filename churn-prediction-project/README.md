# Churn Prediction

## 📝 Description
This project uses customer data to predict churn using machine learning models.  
It includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 📂 Files Included
- `churn_prediction.ipynb` — Main notebook with all steps
- `churn_data.csv` — Dataset used for training

## 🔍 Key Features / What I Did
- Cleaned and visualized customer data
- Engineered features like tenure and service usage
- Trained Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers
- Evaluated accuracy using confusion matrix

## 📊 Libraries Used
- pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 🧠 Result / Outcome
Model achieved approx. 85% accuracy.  
Identified key churn indicators: low tenure, high monthly charges, and contract type.
